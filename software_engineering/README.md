# CCV RSE Assignment

You will need to complete one of the given options:

### 1. Deep dive into existing, original software

If you have existing software that you have significantly contributed to its design and implementation and are able to share, you can choose to submit the code along with clear explanations about how it works and design choices you considered.


#### Requirements:
* The contribution you share is almost entirely your own
  - This excludes for example group projects, or a project where a stencil or starter code was provided
  - If you have a significant standalone contribution to an open source project, that is welcome, but be very clear on what your contribution was and what parts of the code are yours
  * Code can be shared with us
* Language is one of these (if not please consult with us for an explicit approval)
    * C/C++
    * C#
    * Java
    * Javascript/Typescript
    * Julia
    * MATLAB
    * Python
    * R
    * Ruby
    * Rust
   

#### Deliverables:

* Source code. You must send a link to the repository where the code lives. If the repository is not public, you will need to grant us read permissions
* We have shared a starter repository containing this README with you. Please update this README.md with an overview of the application and any major design decisions you made. Please explain explicitly what were your contributions to the project and why you chose this project for submission
* Demonstration of working application. Here you have choices:
   * (Required) Short recording (3-7 minutes) of a walk-through of the features of your working application and key parts of the code. You should tell us in particular what you care about in code, and how you incorporated those things into your solution. **This recording is likely the most impactful part of your application.**
   * (Optional) Live deployment (if applicable)

### 2. Code something new 

If you prefer to code something new, please follow the instructions below.

The main objective of this assignment is to develop code that provides an interactive summary or visualization that helps CCV determine which of its public repositories in the [brown-ccv GitHub organization](https://github.com/brown-ccv) could/should be archived. We are purposely leaving the choice of technologies, metrics, and visualizations up to you. Please feel free to reach out if you have questions. Below are some things we like, which may help you guide your choices:

* We like polished, interactive presentations. This could be a web app (e.g. React, Vue), a notebook (e.g. Jupyter, Observable, Pluto), or another technology you love 
* We are fans of live queries to the [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest)
  * The [repositories endpoint](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos) may be useful
* We are fans of well formatted code, comments, types, modularity
* We are fans of interactive visualizations
* We are fans of a good README.md
* We are fans of conventional commits

#### Deliverables
* Source code. We have shared a starter repository containing this README with you. Please commit all code (no build files please!) to this repo. If working with Observable, contact us for instructions
* Update this README.md with explanations about how to run your code and an overview of the application and any major design decisions you made.
* Demonstration of working application. Here you have choices.
   * (Required) Short recording (3-7 minutes) of a walk-through of the features of your working application and key parts of the code. You should tell us in particular what you care about in code, and how you incorporated those things into your solution. **This recording is likely the most impactful part of your application.**
   * (Very Optional) Deployment to the web (e.g. Netlify, Heroku, GH Pages). If working with notebooks, you can submit a link to an executable environment in Binder, Google Colab or platform of choice

Please try your best. We'll evaluate whatever you provide us, even if your solution is incomplete.
