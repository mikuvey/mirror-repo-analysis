# CCV Data Scientist and Research Software Engineering Assignments

Thank you for taking the time to complete this programming assignment. Through this exercise, we seek to get an insight into your:
* knowledge and skills in data science and software engineering
* approach to problem solving
* software development practices

Members of our group come from very diverse backgrounds. We understand that methodologies vary greatly depending on your background. While we provide some guidance on technology and approach, you are welcome to use the approach and technology that you are most comfortable with and gives you a fair opportunity to complete the assignment and show us your best work.

If completing this assignment would be an undue burden, please reach out and we will work with you to find another way to assess your technical experience.

## Organization

There are two options for assignments:
* a [data science assignment](/data_science) where you review a publication and implement one of the methods described
* a [software engineering assignment](/software_engineering) where you code an interactive summary or visualization

Both assignments also provide for the opportunity to share work you have already done and that you think represents your skills well.

**Feel free to read and submit either of the assignments.** For instance, if you have applied for a Data Scientist position, but think the Software Engineering assignment will give you an opportunity to better showcase your technical strengths, then feel free to submit the Software Engineering assignment. 

## Time to completion
This will be detailed in the email from John.

## Use of Large Language Models (LLMs)

We'd prefer you don't use an LLM for this assignment. 

We know that a lot of people use LLMs in their day-to-day work, including many in our group. However, what we're really trying to understand with these exercises is how _you_ think, and what _you_ value in code. 

If you did use an LLM, tell us _how_ you used it, because that may help differentiate your application. Please share with us:
- Any prompts you gave it,
- Why you chose that way of using the LLM rather than any other way,
- Whether the LLM helped or hindered your output, and 
- Whether you decided to use its output in the end, and why.

## After completion
It usually takes us a couple of weeks to go through assignments. Continuing candidates will be invited for an on-site interview day.
